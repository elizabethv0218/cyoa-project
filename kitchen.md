# Kitchen
You enter the kitchen already planning to make yourself a Nutella sandwich. As you were about to switch the light on you notice that it's very dark outside through the kitchen window. You rub your sleepy eyes and realize that it's not pitch black outside after all, there's just a great shadow. Someone is standing still in front of the window!
