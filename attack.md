# Attack!
With a firm grip on the bat you take a swing and hit the shadow across the face. You continue attacking the intruder until you're sure they're on the floor unconscious. You grab your phone and dial 911.  
The police show up in no time and take the criminal away. One of them leads you to an ambulence where a sudden wave of fatigue hits you. A paramedic tells you to sleep for now. Your eyes slowly close shut before you even ask about your younger sibling... 

Don't worry, you're **safe and sound** now.

**You've reached the GOOD ending!**
